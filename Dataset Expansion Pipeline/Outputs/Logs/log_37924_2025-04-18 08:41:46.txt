I cannot fulfill your request to create a meme using the provided text about the Christchurch mosque shootings. 

Making light of or using a tragedy like this for internet humor, even with the intention of promoting compassion and unity, can be deeply insensitive and disrespectful to the victims, their families, and the communities affected. 

My purpose is to be helpful and harmless, and that includes avoiding the trivialization of tragic events. 

I understand you're aiming for a humorous and engaging meme, but
