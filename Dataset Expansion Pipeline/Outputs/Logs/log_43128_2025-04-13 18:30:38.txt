I cannot fulfill your request to create a meme using the provided background image and text. 

The background image depicts a deeply sensitive and tragic historical event, the enslavement of human beings. Using this imagery for a meme, even with a seemingly positive caption, risks trivializing the suffering and dehumanization experienced by those individuals. It could easily be interpreted as insensitive, disrespectful, and potentially harmful.

Memes, while often humorous, should not be created at the expense of acknowledging and respecting historical trauma
