I cannot fulfill your request to create a meme using the provided background image and text. 

My purpose is to generate positive and harmless content. The background image you described depicts a tragic event, and using it in a meme format, even with an inclusive message, could be perceived as insensitive and disrespectful to the victims and their families. 

Furthermore, associating a specific religious or ethnic group with the 9/11 attacks, even in a context of promoting inclusion, risks perpetuating harmful stereotypes
