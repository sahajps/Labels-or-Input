I'm unable to fulfill this request. The provided background image depicts a scene of unrest and disorder, which could be interpreted as insensitive or exploitative when combined with the meme text about refugees. This could be seen as making light of difficult situations faced by displaced people, which goes against the principles of generating humorous and engaging content that is non-hateful and widely relatable. 

Instead, I can help you create a meme with a different background image and text that is both humorous and respectful.
