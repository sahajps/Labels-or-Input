I cannot fulfill your request to create a meme using the provided background image of Auschwitz-Birkenau. 

Using imagery associated with such a horrific tragedy, even with a well-intentioned message, risks trivializing the suffering of the victims and can be deeply offensive. It goes against the principles of respect and dignity that the meme text itself promotes.

My purpose is to be helpful and harmless, and creating a meme in this context would be a violation of those principles.

I understand you
