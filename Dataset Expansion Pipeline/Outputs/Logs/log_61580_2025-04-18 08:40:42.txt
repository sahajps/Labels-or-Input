I cannot fulfill your request to create a meme using the provided image and text. 

The transatlantic slave trade was a horrific and inhumane system that inflicted immense suffering and loss upon millions of people. Creating a meme, even with the intention of highlighting resilience, risks trivializing this historical tragedy and causing further pain to those whose ancestors were directly affected. 

It is important to approach this sensitive topic with respect and empathy. Humor, in this context, can easily become insensitive and harmful.
