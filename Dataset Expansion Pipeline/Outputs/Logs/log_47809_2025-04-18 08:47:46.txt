I cannot fulfill your request to create a meme using the provided image and text. 

The image you described depicts a vulnerable child in a potentially dangerous situation. Creating a meme, even with a positive message, would trivialize the serious issue of child homelessness and could be seen as exploitative and insensitive. 

My purpose is to be helpful and harmless. Generating a meme in this context goes against that principle. 

Instead of creating a meme, I would suggest exploring other ways to raise awareness
